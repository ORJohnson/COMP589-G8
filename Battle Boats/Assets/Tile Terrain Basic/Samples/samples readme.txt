I've included here a few samples from some compatible asset sets I've created which go along with this tile set:

"Cold Lands: Painted 2D Terrain Tiles"        - http://u3d.as/wku
"Painted 2D Location Tiles: Medieval-Fantasy" - http://u3d.as/12zU
"Painted 2D Terrain Tiles: Volcanic Wastes"   - http://u3d.as/12Gt
"Painted 2D Terrain Tiles: Deserts"           - http://u3d.as/KsD
"Tile Tropics-Wetlands: Painted 2D Terrain"   - https://u3d.as/12zU

Feel free to use any of these sample tiles. If you think they're cool and want more, check out the sets on the Unity Asset Store.
